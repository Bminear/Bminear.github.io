    <h1>Welcome to Brady Minear's website</h1>
    <h2>Major: Advanced Manufacturing</h2>
    <p>I chose advanced manufacturing because I enjoy machining and building things with my hands.</p> 
    <p>I want to try to design things as well so I'm trying out some industrial design classes to see if its a good fit.</p>
